  ## 🗣️ About

> _This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization. You will create your first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if you can’t use VirtualBox)
under specific instructions. Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up
your own operating system while implementing strict rules._

- setting up a firewall using `UFW`
- configuring system administration with `sudo`
- implementing strong password policy using `libpam-quality`
- setting up a `cron` task to run a monitoring script every 10 minutes
  
This project also covered the basics of criptography, networking, hard disk partitioning, and shell scripting (lots of output formatting!)
